## 💡 What to Expect
After receiving a new or rebuilt computer, you will notice some extra security checks during your first few sign-ins. This is normal as your new device needs to establish trust with our systems.

### Why This Happens
*   **Extra MFA Prompts:** The system needs to verify it's really you on a new device.
*   **Device Registration:** Your device will automatically register itself with our management system (e.g., Microsoft Intune for Windows or Jamf for Mac).
*   **Short Delays:** It may take a few minutes for all security policies to sync and for access to work normally.

> **This is Normal Behaviour**
>
> Receiving MFA prompts on first sign-in or seeing temporary access restrictions is expected. Please complete the initial setup and allow a few minutes for everything to sync.
>
> Log a ticket only if you are still blocked after waiting 15-30 minutes and restarting the device.
