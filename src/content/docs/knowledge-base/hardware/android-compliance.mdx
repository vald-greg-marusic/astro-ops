## 💡 What “Non-Compliant” Means
Your Android device is considered "non-compliant" if it doesn't meet the minimum security requirements to access company data. This is a protective measure to keep our data safe.

### Common Causes & How to Fix Them

1.  **Outdated OS:** Your Android version is too old.
    *   **Fix:** Go to **Settings > Software Update** and install any available updates.
2.  **No PIN/Biometrics:** Your device is not secured with a screen lock.
    *   **Fix:** Go to **Settings > Security & Privacy** and set a PIN, password, or fingerprint.
3.  **Company Portal Issues:** The Company Portal app is not installed, signed in, or synced.
    *   **Fix:** Open the **Company Portal** app, sign in with your work email, and tap **"Check status"** to sync the device.
