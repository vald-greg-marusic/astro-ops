## ✅ Prerequisites

You must have a Microsoft licence that enables Universal Print to use this guide. Please contact us via Siit if you're unsure.

VALD HQ is equipped with three cloud-connected printers. They are named:

*   🐨 BNE-Wombat-MFC (Finance area)
*   🦘 BNE-Kangaroo-MFC (Track & Field area)
*   🦔 BNE-Echidna-MFC (Mezzanine area)

All of these printers use Microsoft Universal Print, allowing you to install them directly from the cloud without manual driver setups.

## <WindowsIcon /> Installation Instructions for Windows

1.  Open Printer Settings

    Click the link below to jump straight to the printer configuration menu: 👇
    [ms-settings:printers](ms-settings:printers)

    Open in a new tab >

    (Alternatively: Press the Windows Key, type "Printers", and select Printers & scanners).

2.  Click the Add device button. Windows will take a moment to scan for nearby devices.

3.  A dropdown will appear next to Show printers and scanners associated with my - select Work or school from the dropdown here.

4.  Locate the printer closest to you and click Add device to start installing the printer. Once the status changes to Ready, the printer is installed and available in all your apps.

    📝 You may need to exit out of settings and go back into Printers before the status changes from installing to ready.

⚠️It may take up to 30 minutes for a printer to install successfully and be ready for printing. Please be patient.

## <AppleIcon /> Installation Instructions for macOS

### Launch and setup the Application

1.  Open Finder > Applications or use Spotlight Search (Cmd + Space) to find the Universal Print application.
2.  Open the application.
3.  When the app opens for the first time, you will need to give it permissions. Click Allow and then reopen System Settings.
4.  Go to the application in System Settings and sign-in with your VALD M365 account. If you have platform SSO configured this should happen automatically.

### Find and Install a Printer

Once signed in, click the Add Printer button.
Use the search bar and type BNE to find relevant printers. (You must do this for printers to appear).
Select the printer(s) you wish to install and click Add Printer.

The relevant printer(s) will now be installed and be ready for use.

### Verify & Print

To verify, go to System Settings > Printers & Scanners. The new printer(s) should appear in the list.

You can now select this printer from the print dialog in any application (Word, Chrome, etc.).

## Common Issues:

*   "Driver Unavailable": Please restart your computer. This refreshes the Universal Print service and usually resolves the error.
*   Printer not listed: Ensure you clicked the "Work or School" link in Step 3 for Windows.
*   Still stuck? Please submit a request and IT will investigate further.
