## 💡 Why Removable Media is Restricted
To prevent accidental data loss and protect our network from malware, the use of removable storage devices is blocked on all company computers by default.

### What’s Blocked
*   USB thumb drives / flash drives
*   External hard drives (unless specifically encrypted and approved)
*   SD Cards

## ✅ What to Use Instead
For transferring and storing files, please use the company-approved cloud storage solutions:
*   **OneDrive:** For your personal work files.
*   **SharePoint / Teams:** For collaborative files shared with your team.

> **Requesting an Exception**
>
> Exceptions are rare and are only granted for specific, approved business needs. If you have a business case, log a ticket including the **device type**, a clear **business reason**, and the **duration** for which you need access.
