## 💡 What this means
Your sign-in was blocked by an automated security policy. This happens when the system detects a risk, or if your device or location doesn't meet security requirements.

### Common Causes
*   You are using a **new or recently rebuilt** device.
*   The system detected a **risky sign-in** (e.g., from an unusual location).
*   Your device is missing **MFA registration** or is not **compliant**.

## ✅ What to Try First

1.  Ensure you complete all **MFA prompts** on your Authenticator App.
2.  Retry signing in from a **trusted network** (e.g., your home network instead of a public cafe).
3.  **Restart** your browser or your entire device.

> **When to log a ticket**
>
> If access is still blocked after trying the steps above, please log a ticket with the Service Desk. Include the **exact error message**, the **time** of the failed sign-in, and a **Correlation ID** if one is shown.
