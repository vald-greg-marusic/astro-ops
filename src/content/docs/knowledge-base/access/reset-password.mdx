## 💡 Overview
If you have forgotten your password or it has expired, you can reset it using the Microsoft Online Password Reset tool. This will update your password for **Email**, **Teams**, and your computer login.

> **Requirement:** You must have set up your security info (Microsoft Authenticator or Phone) previously.

## 📋 Instructions

1.  Go to **[aka.ms/sspr](https://aka.ms/sspr)**.
2.  Enter your **Company Email Address**.
3.  Complete the verification challenge (e.g., approve the notification in the **Microsoft Authenticator** app or enter the code sent to your phone).
4.  Create a new password that meets the complexity requirements:
    *   At least 12 characters.
    *   Includes uppercase, lowercase, and a number.

## ❓ Still Locked Out?
If you cannot access your authentication methods, please submit a request at **[vald.siit.io](https://vald.siit.io)**.
