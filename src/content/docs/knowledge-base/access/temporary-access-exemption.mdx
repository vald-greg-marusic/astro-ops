## 💡 What This Is
A temporary access exemption is a **short-term, time-limited** exception to a security policy. It is used as a last resort to resolve a business-critical access issue when no other alternative is available.

### What to Include in a Request
When logging a ticket for an exemption, you must include:
*   **User(s) affected:** Who needs the exemption?
*   **Business Impact:** What critical work is blocked?
*   **Required Duration:** How long is the exemption needed for (e.g., 2 hours, 1 day)?

> **Important Notes**
>
> *   Exemptions are **not permanent**.
> *   All requests require manager and/or IT leadership **approval**.
> *   All approved exemptions are **logged and reviewed** by the security team.
